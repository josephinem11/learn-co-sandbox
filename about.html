  <h2>Human Impacts & Conservation Efforts</h2>
    <body>
 Naturally, we all impact the world in some way, shape or form. In some ways, we are permantly altering our environment.It is imperitive that we as humans ensure the world we live in remains healthy because the state of the Earth affects every organism. the conservation of our environment has become increasingly more important with global warming strengthening natural disasters. The lasting effects we are imposing on our planet become more pronounced with every year that passes. While protecting our environment will take unprecedented effort,it is more than worth it to  not only to improve our quality of life but to also ensure a future for those who come after us. 
    Things like green house gases contribute to global warming which makes for more powerful, destructive hurricanes. It causes a higher risk for natural disasters is because of all the fossil fuel that's used to produce just one hamburger is enough to drive 20 miles! The animals that we kill for the meat contribute to the air that we use to breathe because of the deforestation.
    <p>
    Deforestation is the clearing and killing off of trees. For example, a lot of the Amazon rainforest has been deforested to make way for the cattle.

  <h2>The Impact of Natural Disasters</h2>
    <body class=testing>
      
      The impact a natural disaster could make on a community and an entire group of people is most of the time devastating! Hurricanes usually end in a high death toll. Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico left a death toll of 4,645 people! The "eye"(center) of a hurricane can be about 20 miles of a diameter! The diameter of a hurricane is about 400 to 500 miles! That's about the distance from San Francisco, CA to Anaheim, CA!

    <p> 
    Hurricanes rise the ocean tides really high! Higher than the average. The average tide is 2 feet, whereas the tides due to a hurricane become 15 feet more! This is because of the storm surge and the astronomical tide combined! It creates a storm tide! Sometimes, hurricanes can cause floods due to the rise in the tide with the storm surge and because of the heavy amount of rain during a storm. 
    <p>
    Floods are another thing that effect people and cause different things to happen to both people's emotions/feelings. The impact of floods includes stuff like loss of houses, loss of personal belongings/treasures, and sometimes, loss of pets and babies. It's important for people to have flood insurance, especially is they live in a high-risk of flood area, because home-owners insurance doesn't cover the damage of floods. Another impact of floods is that more diseases become present with the water. The more water, the worse because of all the bacteria in the flood!
